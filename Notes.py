# (conda env list) -> To check the detail of the previous environment

# conda create -p {name of the environment} python={version}  (-p)-> if we use this then we create environment in the local directory(Here Demo-Pipeline)
# (-n) -> If we use this then it create it in the deafault directory (means in the env of the conda)

# If we use (-n) so for activation directly use conda activate {name of the environment}
# If we use (-p) so for activation use conda activate {path of the environement}(right click on env and copy the path and paste it)
